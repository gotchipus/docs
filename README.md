## 🚀 What is Gotchipus?

**Gotchipus** is a decentralized pet simulation project that merges:
- 🧠 AI-powered NFT agents
- 📦 Modular smart contracts (EIP-2535, ERC-6551, ERC-4337)
- 🎮 GameFi mechanics (rarity, growth, task automation)
- 🕹️ Future integration with a portable onchain console

Summon your Gotchipus using a Lighthouse NFT, stake stablecoins to awaken its soul, and let your pet grow, evolve, and act autonomously on-chain.
