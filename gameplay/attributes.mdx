The Gotchipus ecosystem employs a sophisticated numerical framework designed to provide balanced progression while maintaining strategic depth. This document explains the core mathematical mechanics that govern attribute growth, faction bonuses, and evolution systems.

## ðŸ“Š Core Attribute Framework

### Six Primary Attributes

Each Gotchipus possesses six fundamental attributes that determine their capabilities across various gameplay scenarios. These attributes form the foundation of all strategic decisions and combat calculations:

- **Strength (STR)**: Governs physical attack power and construction efficiency
- **Defense (DEF)**: Controls damage reduction and structural durability  
- **Mind (INT)**: Influences magical abilities and research speed
- **Vitality (VIT)**: Determines health points and recovery rates
- **Agility (AGI)**: Affects action speed and evasion capabilities
- **Luck (LUK)**: Impacts critical hit rates and resource acquisition

### Initial Attribute Calculation

Base attribute values are determined by the Gotchipus rarity tier, following this mathematical relationship:

```
Base_Attribute = 12 + (rarity_level Ã— 3) + special_bonus
```

Where:
- Common (rarity 0): 12 points
- Rare (rarity 1): 15 points  
- Epic (rarity 2): 18 points
- Legendary (rarity 3): 22 points

The special bonus adds 1 additional point for Legendary tier Gotchipus, representing their exceptional nature.

## ðŸ“ˆ Experience & Leveling Mathematics

### Smooth Growth Curve

The experience system uses a continuous mathematical function to ensure smooth progression without artificial barriers. This prevents the common issue of level "walls" that can frustrate players:

```
XP_Required = round((OFFSET + STEP Ã— Level) ^ POWER)
```

**Standard Parameters:**
- OFFSET = 50 (base experience requirement)
- STEP = 25 (linear growth factor)  
- POWER = 1.5 (exponential scaling)

**Example Calculations:**
- Level 1: (50 + 25Ã—1)^1.5 = 650 XP
- Level 10: (50 + 25Ã—10)^1.5 = 5,196 XP
- Level 50: (50 + 25Ã—50)^1.5 = 46,852 XP

This formula ensures that early levels are achievable while higher levels require substantial commitment, maintaining long-term engagement.

### Attribute Point Distribution

The attribute point allocation system balances rapid early growth with sustained long-term progression. Points are awarded based on level ranges with diminishing returns:

**Base Point Formula:**
```
Points_Per_Level = {
    3 if level â‰¤ 20
    2 if 21 â‰¤ level â‰¤ 50  
    1 if 51 â‰¤ level â‰¤ 100
    0.5 if level > 100 (every 2 levels)
}
```

**Rarity Bonus System:**
Every 10 levels, additional points are granted based on rarity:

```
Rarity_Bonus = floor(level / 10) Ã— rarity_multiplier
```

Where rarity_multiplier equals the rarity level (0 for Common, 1 for Rare, 2 for Epic, 3 for Legendary).

**Milestone Rewards:**
Significant level achievements provide bonus attribute points:

```
Milestone_Bonus = floor(level / 25) Ã— 5 + floor(level / 50) Ã— 10 + floor(level / 100) Ã— 20
```

This creates excitement around major level milestones while providing substantial rewards for dedicated players.
