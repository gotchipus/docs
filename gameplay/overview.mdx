## ⚡ Current Gameplay Features

### 🔮 **Summoning System**
Your journey begins with the mystical summoning ritual. Stake coins to awaken your Gotchipus from its dormant Pharos state.

#### Rarity Distribution & Token Bonuses

The summoning process follows a mathematically balanced rarity system designed to reward both casual players and dedicated collectors:

**Base Rarity Rates:**
```
Common:     60% chance
Rare:       25% chance  
Epic:       12% chance
Legendary:   3% chance
```

**Staked Coin Bonus System:**
For players staking significant amounts of coins for summoning, legendary chances receive progressive bonuses:

```
Legendary_Bonus = min(5%, floor(coins_staked / 500) × 1%)
Final_Legendary_Rate = Base_Rate + Legendary_Bonus
```

**Example Calculations:**
- 500 coins staked: 3% + 1% = 4% legendary chance
- 1,000 coins staked: 3% + 2% = 5% legendary chance  
- 2,500+ coins staked: 3% + 5% = 8% legendary chance (maximum)

This bonus system caps at 5% additional chance, ensuring that while high-stake summoners receive meaningful advantages, the summoning process remains fair and accessible to all players.

#### Pity System (Guaranteed Drops)

To ensure all players eventually obtain higher-tier Gotchipus, a progressive pity system guarantees rare drops after specific intervals:

**Pity Counter Mechanics:**
```
Rare Pity:      Guaranteed after 15 consecutive non-rare summons
Epic Pity:      Guaranteed after 30 consecutive non-epic summons  
Legendary Pity: Guaranteed after 60 consecutive non-legendary summons
```

**Pity System Logic:**
```
if (summons_since_rare >= 15) {
    guaranteed_rare = true;
    minimum_rarity = RARE;
}
if (summons_since_epic >= 30) {
    guaranteed_epic = true;  
    minimum_rarity = EPIC;
}
if (summons_since_legendary >= 60) {
    guaranteed_legendary = true;
    minimum_rarity = LEGENDARY;
}
```
