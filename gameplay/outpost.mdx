## Background

At the edge of the deepest oceans, ancient evil stirs beneath the surface.

From the cracks of the Abyss Rift, a forgotten darkness awakens—spreading corruption, madness, and destruction. Humanity, in desperation, builds the Outpost Pharos on the seafloor’s edge. Its purpose: to observe, to warn… and to stand against the invasion.

But a beacon alone isn’t enough.

To survive, humans forged a bond with intelligent onchain lifeforms—Gotchipus—soul-linked AI guardians capable of autonomous defense.

## Game Objective

You are a Lighthouse Commander, entrusted with the last line of defense. Your mission:
    - Build structures like walls, training camps, and sanctums to fortify your Outpost
    - Summon and evolve Gotchipus, programming their behavior via onchain Hooks
    - Defend against waves of deep-sea monsters and creeping Abyssal corruption
    - Survive both external threats and internal betrayal

	Because the greatest danger isn’t always the monster—it’s the other Outposts.

## PVA & PVP

As isolation stretches on, not all Lighthouse Keepers remain sane.
    - Each Outpost is a chain-native base (represented by an NFT)
    - Players can form alliances—or launch raids on rival Outposts
    - Gotchipus may be stolen, corrupted, or even turned against their summoners
    - If your defenses fall, you risk losing not only rewards—but your companion’s soul
