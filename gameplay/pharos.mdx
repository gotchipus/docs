# Pharos: Your Territorial Foundation

**Pharos** is your territorial NFT - a mystical underwater lighthouse surrounded by buildable land. Each Pharos represents your strategic base in the depths of the Abyss, serving as both your faction's headquarters and the foundation for future territorial expansion.

## 🏰 What is a Pharos?

### The Lighthouse
At the center of every Pharos stands an ancient underwater lighthouse, a towering beacon that serves as your command center and the heart of your territorial power.

### Surrounding Territory  
Around the lighthouse lies your territorial domain - underwater land where you can construct buildings, gather resources, and expand your influence. This isn't just empty space; it's valuable real estate with strategic potential.

## 🎯 Pharos in Gameplay

### Your Strategic Base
The Pharos serves as your primary base of operations:

- **Construction Foundation**: All buildings and expansions originate from your Pharos territory
- **Defensive Core**: The lighthouse is your most critical asset - protecting it is essential for survival  
- **Command Center**: Coordinate your Gotchipus commanders and strategic operations from here
- **Territorial Expansion**: Gradually expand your influence beyond the initial territory boundaries

### Faction-Aligned Territories
Each Pharos can be aligned with one of the three factions, influencing its visual style and strategic advantages:

- **⚔️ Combat Pharos**: Military-focused territories with aggressive architectural styling
- **🛡️ Defense Pharos**: Fortified territories emphasizing protection and endurance
- **🔧 Technology Pharos**: Innovation-centered territories showcasing advanced capabilities

## 🎮 Getting Your Pharos

Your journey begins with acquiring a Pharos NFT, which serves as the foundation for all strategic gameplay. Once obtained, you can align it with your chosen faction and begin developing your underwater territory.

Future updates will introduce comprehensive base-building mechanics, territorial warfare, and alliance systems centered around your Pharos lighthouse.
