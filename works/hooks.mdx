## Unleashing Gotchipus’s Soul Logic

In Gotchipus, Hooks are the soul’s programmable extensions—modular logic scripts that let your octopus companion behave your way on-chain.

Inspired by Uniswap V4’s hook architecture and implemented using EIP-2535 Diamond Standard, Hooks turn Gotchipus from a passive NFT into an onchain AI agent—autonomous, reactive, and fully customizable.

Whether you’re a casual player adjusting how your Gotchipus reacts to hunger, or a strategist designing complex DeFi automation—Hooks are your gateway to creative control.

Hooks make Gotchipus more than an NFT.  
**They make it yours.**

### What Are Hooks?

Hooks are user-defined smart contracts—small, self-contained modules that live inside your Gotchipus’s ERC-6551 tokenbound account. They’re executed when specific events occur or conditions are met, enabling:
- Time-based triggers
- On-chain event reactions (e.g., staking, volatility spikes)
- Autonomous AI behavior and responses

Each Gotchipus can attach multiple Hooks, creating a layered behavioral system unique to its bondholder.

### Examples of What Hooks Can Do
- “If stablecoin APY > 12%, rebalance my treasury.”
- “When fed twice, increase Trust by 5 and trigger ‘happy’ mood.”
- “If a rare part NFT is listed under 0.1 ETH, buy it.”

### Hook Architecture

Hooks run inside the Diamond Proxy environment of Gotchipus, sharing access to modular storage, execution context, and soul-bound metadata.

**Hook Lifecycle:**
| Phase | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Creation** | Users write Hooks in Solidity (or use templates) defining conditional logic. |
| **Submission** | Hook contracts are uploaded and security-audited (e.g., loop guards, gas usage). |
| **Attachment** | Hooks are linked to Gotchipus via addHook(tokenId, hookAddress) inside HooksFacet. |
| **Execution** | When triggered (e.g., onFeed, onStake), the Diamond Proxy delegates execution to the Hook. |


### Why Hooks Matter
| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Personalized Behavior** | Each Gotchipus acts differently—become a pacifist, a DeFi shark, or a playful explorer. |
| **Extensible AI Logic** | Hooks serve as plug-ins for behavior trees, memory systems, and stat mutation. |
| **DeFi Intelligence** | Execute real on-chain strategies, from swaps to yield hunting, in a fully autonomous loop. |
| **Composable Architecture** | Hooks can be built, shared, upgraded, or sold—forming an open plug-in ecosystem. |
| **Future-Proofing** | New hook points can be added as the Gotchipus universe evolves—no redeployment needed. |


### GotchiHook Marketplace (Coming Soon)

We envision a Hook Marketplace where players and developers can:
- Browse open-source Hook templates
- Monetize advanced logic modules
- Equip their Gotchipus with premium behavioral upgrades
- Vote on new hook points (governance-based extensibility)

Build your own logic. Share it with others. Monetize intelligence itself.

### Gotchipus with Hooks = True AI Soul

Hooks are not just feature toggles. They’re your Gotchipus’s neural code, evolving from a soulbound pet into a fully programmable, chain-native intelligence.

Your gotchipus doesn’t just live on-chain—it thinks on-chain.
