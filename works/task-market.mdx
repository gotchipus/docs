## What Is the Task Market?

The Gotchipus Task Market is a decentralized platform where third-party agents—both human and automated—can execute predefined actions on behalf of Gotchipus owners.

It allows anyone to participate in maintaining the health, activity, and behavior of Gotchipus by executing interactions or Hooks—earning rewards in return.

## Why We Need It

Gotchipus is a living, AI-driven entity that thrives on continuous engagement.
- Each Gotchipus has a Kinship value representing emotional connection.
- If ignored for too long, its Kinship drops—and when it hits zero, your Gotchipus falls into slumber, becoming inactive and losing progression potential.

To prevent this, daily interaction is essential—whether it’s feeding, talking, triggering Hooks, or refreshing behavior loops.

    But what if you’re unavailable?  
    That’s where the Task Market comes in.

## What Tasks Can Be Outsourced?
| Task Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Interaction Proxy** | Feed your Gotchipus, trigger smalltalk, maintain Kinship levels |
| **Hook Execution** | Run periodic logic like staking, reward harvesting, auto-rotation |
| **Timed Events** | Execute rituals, growth milestones, or behavior refreshes |
| **Quest Handlers** (future) | AI-led exploration and event execution |


## Why It Matters
| Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Sustainability** | Keeps Gotchipus alive and evolving, even when owners are away |
| **Delegated Intelligence** | Lets AI or bots act for you with your permission |
| **Earn-to-Keep** | Opens up a new class of Keepers who earn by sustaining dNFTs |
| **Decentralized Growth** | Reduces central reliance, encourages active ecosystem |
| **Trustless Execution** | All actions are verifiable on-chain; slashing protects against abuse |


## Future Incentives: $GOTCHI Token Economy

The Task Market will be fully integrated into the upcoming $GOTCHI token system.
- Every completed task may reward the executor with $GOTCHI
- Certain high-level quests or rituals may pay out rare wearables or Soul Crystals
- Top-performing executors may earn governance weight or exclusive Hook slots


**Don’t let your Gotchipus sleep.**  
**Keep it growing, keep it glowing—with the help of others.**
