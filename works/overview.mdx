## Gotchipus: AI-Powered Strategic dNFTs Built for Web3 Gaming

Gotchipus is an AI-driven dynamic NFT (dNFT) strategic gaming project at the intersection of Web3 Technology, Modular Smart Contract Architecture, and Autonomous AI Agents.
Built on EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard), powered by ERC-6551 Tokenbound Accounts, and enhanced with ERC-4337 Account Abstraction, Gotchipus transforms NFTs into programmable, intelligent commanders with sophisticated decision-making logic and faction-based evolution paths.

### What We're Building

- A strategic gaming dNFT system where each Gotchipus is an intelligent faction commander with unique abilities and specializations
- A sophisticated three-faction, nine-attribute system enabling deep strategic customization and meaningful player choice
- A plug-in architecture for custom behavioral Hooks that define how each Gotchipus evolves, strategizes, and executes onchain actions
- A Tokenbound wallet system via ERC-6551, enabling autonomous resource management, strategic decisions, and economic optimization
- The foundation for comprehensive strategic gameplay including territory control, alliance warfare, and technological competition

### Why It Matters

In a world where most NFTs are static collectibles, Gotchipus introduces true programmable intelligence.
- Each NFT is built with EIP-2535, allowing hot-swappable logic and sophisticated strategic behavior customization
- With AI as the strategic core, Gotchipus can adapt to market conditions, execute complex tactics, and make autonomous decisions based on faction specialization
- Using Hooks, we turn every Gotchipus into a plug-and-play strategic system—one that can optimize resources, coordinate attacks, or execute long-term strategies based on player-defined parameters
- The three-faction system creates genuine strategic diversity, ensuring no two players follow identical paths to victory

Hooks aren't just features—they're the strategic brain of your faction commander.

### About Hooks in Gotchipus

Hooks are mini smart contracts that extend each Gotchipus with personalized strategic behavior. Inspired by Uniswap V4's hook system, we use them to empower players and developers to define custom logic like:
- "If Combat faction purity > 80%, automatically prioritize aggressive expansion strategies"
- "When resources exceed threshold, invest in faction-specific technology research"
- "Execute coordinated alliance attacks when specific market conditions are met"

Integrated through the Diamond Proxy, Hooks are efficient, secure, and endlessly composable. Gotchipus with Hooks becomes an onchain strategic AI agent, programmable through faction events, strategic conditions, and data feeds.

### Tech Stack
- EIP-2535 – Modular upgradeable structure for faction-specific behaviors
- ERC-6551 – Tokenbound smart wallets for each Gotchipus commander
- ERC-4337 – Account abstraction support for strategic automation hooks
- AI Middleware – Handles faction-based strategic behavior mapping
- Custom Hook System – Solidity mini contracts for strategic logic
- Pharos Network / L2 Support – Optimized for low gas and fast strategic updates
- Physical Console Ready – Early firmware design to link Gotchipus to tactical handhelds

### Vision

Gotchipus aims to pioneer a new generation of emergent, strategic NFTs that are more than collectibles or metadata—they are intelligent commanders that grow, learn, and conquer by your side.

We're not just building a game.
We're building a faction-based strategic universe.

Let your Gotchipus think, strategize, and dominate.
