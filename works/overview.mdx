## Gotchipus: AI-Powered Soul-Bonded dNFTs Built for GameFi

Gotchipus is an AI-driven dynamic NFT (dNFT) pet project at the intersection of GameFi, Modular Smart Contract Architecture, and Onchain AI Agents.
Built on EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard), powered by ERC-6551 Tokenbound Accounts, and enhanced with ERC-4337 Account Abstraction, Gotchipus transforms NFTs into programmable, self-aware companions with their own decision-making logic and evolution paths.

### What We’re Building

- A GameFi-native AI dNFT system where each Gotchipus (a soul-linked octopus) is a modular, intelligent companion
- A plug-in architecture for custom behavioral Hooks that define how each Gotchipus evolves, behaves, and interacts onchain
- A Tokenbound wallet brain via ERC-6551, enabling DeFi execution, metadata transformation, or auto-staking behavior
- The foundation for a physical AI pet console, bringing Gotchipus into your hands as a programmable onchain pet companion

### Why It Matters

In a world where most NFTs are static, Gotchipus introduces true programmable life.
- Each NFT is composed with EIP-2535, allowing hot-swappable logic and highly customizable behavior.
- With AI as the soul, Gotchipus metadata can reflect real emotions (happy, hungry), adapt to chain data (volatility, staking APR), or execute autonomous actions.
- Using Hooks, we turn every Gotchipus into a plug-and-play logic system—one that can grow, trade, react, or strategize based on player-defined code.

Hooks aren’t just features—they’re the evolutionary core of Gotchipus.

### About Hooks in Gotchipus

Hooks are mini smart contracts that extend each Gotchipus with personalized behavior. Inspired by Uniswap V4’s hook system, we use them to empower players and developers to define custom logic like:
- “If stablecoin staking > $500, increase Light affinity by 3”
- “Auto-buy rare upgrade parts when token dips 5%”
- “Swap for ETH every 24h if treasury > $100”

Integrated through the Diamond Proxy, Hooks are efficient, secure, and endlessly composable. Gotchipus with Hooks becomes an onchain AI pet agent, programmable through events, conditions, or data feeds.

### Tech Stack
- EIP-2535 – Modular upgradeable structure for plug-in behaviors
- ERC-6551 – Tokenbound smart wallets for each Gotchipus
- ERC-4337 – Account abstraction support for programmable action hooks
- AI Middleware – Handles onchain behavior mapping
- Custom Hook System – Solidity mini contracts for personality logic
- Pharos Network / L2 Support – Optimized for low gas and fast updates
- Physical Console Ready – Early firmware design to link Gotchipus to handhelds

### Vision

Gotchipus aims to pioneer a new generation of emergent, autonomous NFTs that are more than art or metadata—they are intelligent beings that grow, learn, and battle by your side.

We’re not just building a game.
We’re building a soul-based NFT runtime.

Let your Gotchipus think, feel, and fight.
