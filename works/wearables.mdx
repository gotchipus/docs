## What Are Wearables in Gotchipus?

Gotchipus is not just a dynamic NFT (dNFT)—it’s a modular AI pet, and Wearables are the digital extensions that make each companion truly unique.

Wearables are NFT-based items that can be equipped to a Gotchipus to:
- Modify stats (e.g., increase Soul Energy, Trust, Defense)
- Unlock new behaviors or Hook slots
- Alter visual appearance (e.g., bioluminescent glow, elemental markings)
- Bind specific onchain logic (e.g., DeFi routines, auto-reactions)

Think of them as not just cosmetics—but plug-ins for the AI soul.

## Built for dNFT Architecture

All Gotchipus wearables are integrated using:
- **✅ ERC-6551 Tokenbound Accounts**  
    Each Gotchipus owns its own wallet—equipped wearables are stored inside its identity.
- **✅ Composable Metadata**  
    Gotchipus dynamically updates its metadata and visual layers when new equipment is attached or removed.
- **✅ Diamond Storage**  
    Equipment logic can be processed via Hook slots or external upgrades without redeploying the core NFT contract.


## Why Wearables Matter

| **dNFT Modularity** | Make your NFT truly programmable & customizable |
| **Value Layering** | Introduce onchain value and upgrade economics |

Gotchipus wearables are not accessories.  
They are extensions of soul, strategy, and self.

Equip your future. Program your gotchipus.
