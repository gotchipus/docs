<Warning>
    The $PUS token is currently not deployed.  
    Everything described in this document is part of our forward-looking roadmap and subject to change as the Gotchipus ecosystem evolves.

## What is $PUS?

$PUS is the planned utility and incentive token for the Gotchipus universe.  
It is designed to power gameplay, reward community contributions, and serve as the core currency for interactions between Gotchipus, players, AI agents, and the world around them.

## Planned Utilities

Once launched, $PUS may be used for:
| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task Market Rewards** | Distributed to Keepers and Executors for completing daily tasks, Hook executions, and AI maintenance |
| **Wearable Crafting** & Upgrading | Used to fuse, refine, or upgrade Gotchipus equipment |
| **Growth Acceleration** | Speed up Gotchipus evolution or unlock special Hook slots |
| **Marketplace Currency** | Medium of exchange for Hook templates, soul modules, visual cosmetics |
| **Governance** (Future) | Vote on new Hook types, summoning events, token economics, and more |
| **Console Interactions** | Possibly required for advanced actions on physical AI pet console (e.g. offline-to-onchain syncs) |


## Design Philosophy

$PUS is not just a reward token—it’s a behavioral layer for the Gotchipus ecosystem. It ties together:
- AI agents who act
- Keepers who execute
- Players who own
- Developers who extend

By rewarding useful interaction, rather than passive holding, $PUS reinforces the soul-bound nature of your Gotchipus.

## Why Not Deploy Now?

We believe in launching tokens only when there’s real usage.  
Until the Gotchipus Task Market, Hook Layer, and AI Console are live, we’ll focus on building value—not hype.

When the time is right, $PUS will emerge not as a promise—but as proof of participation.


**Gotchipus is soulbound.**   
**$PUS is its heartbeat.**
