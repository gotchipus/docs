## What is a Pharos NFT?

The Pharos NFT is the genesis artifact of the Gotchipus universe.

A total of 20,000 Pharos NFTs will be minted and distributed during the initial phase of the project. Each one represents a summoning beacon—a sacred digital relic capable of awakening a Gotchipus from the depths of the Abyss.

Just as Phaross guide ships through darkness, Pharos NFTs guide souls into Web3 existence.


## Core Function: Summon a Gotchipus

Each Pharos NFT grants the holder the right to summon one Gotchipus by:
1.	**Staking a predefined amount of stablecoins**
    - This powers the soul-bond mechanism and gives the Gotchipus real economic value.
2.	**Initiating the Summon Ritual via smart contract**
    - This burns the Pharos NFT
    - Triggers the AI soul-bond creation
    - Generates a soul-linked Gotchipus dNFT, unique in element and traits
3.	**Binding the Gotchipus to your address**
    - From this point forward, you and your Gotchipus are bonded—until one of you falls into slumber.

## Rarity Determination

Each time you use a Pharos NFT to summon a Gotchipus, its rarity is determined by a verifiable on-chain random number, fetched via a trusted oracle such as Chainlink VRF.

There are 5 rarity tiers, each with its own probability range:
| Rarity Tier | Range(Low) | Range(High) | Probability |
|-------------|-------------|-------------| ------------- |
| Common | 0–24 | 75–99 | 50% |
| Rare | 25–37 | 63–74 | 25% |
| Epic | 38–44 | 56–62 | 14% |
| Legendary | 45–48 | 52–55 | 8% |
| Mythical | 49–51 | - | 3% |

This split ensures both fairness and excitement—with even a small chance at greatness every time you summon.

## Verifiability via Chainlink VRF

All summoning randomness is generated using Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF), guaranteeing that:
- The source of randomness is tamper-proof
- Every outcome can be publicly verified
- Rarity is provably fair, not manipulable by contracts or users

This means no backdoor minting, no rigged drops—just pure cryptographic fairness.
