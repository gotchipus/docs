## What is a Pharos NFT?

Welcome to the Pharos NFT, the genesis key to the Gotchipus universe! Think of it as a sacred digital beacon, straight from the Abyss, ready to summon your very own Gotchipus—a unique octopus soul bonded to you in the Web3 world.
We’re minting 20,000 Pharos NFTs in the initial drop. Just like a lighthouse guides ships through the dark, these Pharos NFTs light the way for a Gotchipus to emerge from the depths.

## Core Function: Summon a Gotchipus
Each Pharos NFT is your ticket to awaken a Gotchipus. Here’s how it works:  
1. **Stake Some Stablecoins**  
    Drop a set amount of stablecoins to fuel the soul-bond process. This gives your Gotchipus real economic juice.

2. **Start the Summon Ritual**  
    - Fire up the smart contract to burn your Pharos NFT.  
    - This kicks off the creation of a soul-linked Gotchipus dNFT, powered by a 256-bit DNA ID that unpacks into 33,000 genes.  
    - Those genes shape its look, personality, and special powers—unique every time!

3. **Bond with Your Gotchipus**  
    Once summoned, your Gotchipus is tied to your address. You’re partners now—until one of you drifts back into the Abyss.


## Genes Decide Everything
Forget fixed rarity tables—your Gotchipus is born from its genes! Each one starts with a 256-bit DNA ID, expanded into 33,000 genes that control:
    - **Appearance**: Tentacle shapes, eye colors, skin vibes.  
    - **Personality**: Curious, chill, or a total jokester?  
    - **Special Abilities**: Color-changing, glowing, maybe even ink-spraying skills!

Each of those 33,000 genes can have 10 possible styles—like 10 flavors for every trait. That means the number of possible Gotchipus combos is 10 raised to the power of 33,000. To put it in perspective, that’s way more than the number of atoms in the universe (which is around 10^80). Rarity isn’t a roll of the dice—it’s baked into the gene combos, with some traits (like glowing starry tentacles) popping up way less often, making every Gotchipus a one-of-a-kind gem.


## How’s It All Fair?
No oracles, no pre-set odds—just pure gene magic. The 256-bit DNA ID is your starting seed, and our algorithm stretches it into a massive genome. It’s all on-chain, verifiable, and tamper-proof. Same seed, same Gotchipus—every time. No tricks, just tech.


## What’s Next?
Your Gotchipus isn’t just a pretty face—its 33,000 genes feed into some serious AI magic:
    - Evolving Stories: AI crafts richer backstories over time, adapting to your Gotchipus’ adventures or traits.  
    - Personality Growth: The more you interact, the more the AI refines its personality—maybe your shy octopus turns bold!  
    - AI-Powered Skills: Future updates could let AI simulate your Gotchipus’ abilities, like real-time color-changing visuals or glowing effects.
