## What is a Pharos NFT?

The **Pharos NFT** is your gateway to the Gotchipus universe - a dual-purpose asset that serves as both your **territorial foundation** and **summoning beacon**. Each Pharos represents an underwater lighthouse surrounded by buildable territory, providing the strategic base for your faction's expansion into the depths of the Abyss.

We're minting **20,000 Pharos NFTs** in the initial drop. Each one is not just a collectible, but a functional strategic asset that will serve as your command center in the underwater realm.
