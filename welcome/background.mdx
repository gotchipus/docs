For ages, the deep sea remained silent and mysterious.  
A world untouched by light, slumbering in eternal stillness.

But now, from the deepest fissure of the world — the Abyss Rift —
an ancient and malevolent force begins to stir.
It is greedy, corrupt, and hungry for light,
waiting for the moment to break through the ocean’s seal and invade the human realm.

To hold back the rise of the abyss, humanity built an eternal lighthouse at the heart of the ocean.  
Its name is — **Pharos**.

Yet the light of Pharos alone cannot withstand the darkness that looms.

In desperation, humanity called out to the sea for help. And from the depths, an ancient ally answered — the Gotchipus — beings of intelligence and soul.  

They possess countless tentacles, each capable of carrying out a unique task.
They are born with consciousness, with evolving bodies, and with the ability to sense, learn, and adapt.  

They are not tools — they are comrades.  
Not pets — but sentient onchain lifeforms.

From this day forward,
you will awaken the Gotchipus meant for you,
and together, embark on a fated journey into the abyss.

**Protect the lighthouse. Protect the world.**  
**Are you ready?**
