The digital pet market is roaring back to life. In 2023, Tamagotchi Uni sold over 1 million units, 
while Bitzee’s interactive toys topped holiday charts, 
pushing the global virtual pet market toward a projected $500 million by 2025 (Statista). 
Nostalgia meets innovation, yet Web3 remains untapped—few projects merge blockchain with physical pet devices, creating a blue ocean opportunity.


Gotchipus aims to lead this frontier with a portable AI pet console. 
Imagine a palm-sized device, styled in retro pixel glory, where your Gotchipus thrives. Feed it, send it on forest quests, 
or watch it evolve—all synced via NFC to its on-chain NFT. Unlike traditional toys, 
our console integrates Web3: trade parts, stake LP, or battle MEV bots, 
blending physical play with digital ownership. The Smart Spirit runs locally, 
ensuring offline interactivity with periodic chain updates.


The vision is bold yet grounded. Phase 1 prototypes will launch post-MVP, targeting early adopters by Q4 2025. 
Mass production follows, aiming for 10,000 units by 2026, capturing 10% of the Web3 gaming niche. With Unichain’s efficiency and a growing community (target: 10K users), 
Gotchipus’s Pocket Pet could redefine pet care—bridging the gap between blockchain and your pocket.
