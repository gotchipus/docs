Gotchipus technical architecture is built on a robust stack of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and standards, ensuring modularity, autonomy, and scalability:

### Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol
To enable seamless collaboration between autonomous AI agents within the Gotchipus ecosystem, we integrate Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, an open standard for interoperable AI agent communication. A2A allows Gotchipus’ AI-driven entities—such as pet nurturing agents, battle strategists, or DeFi optimizers—to securely exchange information and coordinate actions across diverse platforms and frameworks. Using A2A’s capability discovery, each Gotchipus can advertise its unique abilities (e.g., trading Uniswap LP tokens or optimizing MEV resistance) via JSON-based Agent Cards, enabling dynamic task delegation to specialized external agents. The protocol’s task management framework ensures real-time synchronization for complex, long-running workflows, such as cross-protocol DeFi strategies or community-driven pet evolution events. Built on standard web technologies like HTTP and JSON-RPC, A2A integrates seamlessly with Pharos’ infrastructure, enhancing scalability while maintaining enterprise-grade security through OpenAPI-aligned authentication. By leveraging A2A, Gotchipus transforms into a networked, collaborative AI ecosystem, capable of interacting with third-party agents and driving innovative Web3 experiences.

### EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard)
Unlike traditional monolithic contracts, Gotchipus uses a Diamond Proxy structure. Functions are split into “Facets” (e.g., CoreFacet, DeFiFacet), enabling independent upgrades without redeploying the entire contract. This modularity supports our evolving ecosystem, from NFT minting to future palm console integration, while optimizing gas costs via shared storage.

### ERC-6551 (Tokenbound Accounts)
Each Gotchipus is more than an NFT—it’s a self-contained wallet. ERC-6551 grants every token an address, allowing it to hold Uniswap LP Tokens, parts, and ETH, and execute on-chain actions autonomously. This transforms Gotchipus into a living entity capable of interacting with DeFi protocols.

### ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)
To eliminate gas barriers, we implement ERC-4337, enabling gasless interactions. External agents (like AI or Keepers) can pay fees on behalf of users, making nurturing seamless—whether feeding your pet or battling MEV bots.

### Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Randomness Function)
Fairness is key. When summoning your Gotchipus, Chainlink VRF generates random numbers to assign one of three factions, nine possible attributes, and rarity levels (Common to Legendary). This ensures transparency and unpredictability in faction assignment, attribute mastery levels, and evolution potential, enhancing both strategic diversity and collectible value.

Deployed on Pharos, Gotchipus leverages its high throughput and low fees, aligning with our vision of an accessible, dynamic pet ecosystem. These protocols empower a scalable, future-proof platform ready for Web3 innovation.
